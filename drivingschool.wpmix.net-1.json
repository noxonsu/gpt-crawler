But now, researchers are using pioneering drones to scout out and map the miles of algae mats.\n\nThe Antarctic algae begin growing in early spring and rely on the small amount of sunlight that penetrates the ice to survive. They play a key role in the Antarctic food chain by supplying food for krill and other tiny animals.\n\nWITH A RADIOMETER THAT MEASURES HOW MUCH LIGHT EACH CLUMP OF ALGAE ABSORBS. BASED ON THE MEASUREMENTS, SCIENTISTS CAN PREDICT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALGAE GROWING UNDER THE ICE.\n\nThe diving drones are 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) long and are shaped like torpedoes. The devices are deployed from holes that the researchers cut into the thick ice using an oil burner and a steam drill. The carefully carved holes also happen to be an ideal entry point for hunting seals, and sometimes, the researchers have to share their space with seals and sea lions that crowd around the heaters set up to keep the holes from icing over.\n\nAlgae growing on the bottom of sea ice absorb light at different wavelengths. Each torpedo-shaped drone is equipped with a radiometer that measures how much light each clump of algae absorbs. Based on the measurements, scientists can predict the total amount of algae growing under the ice.\n\nGET MORE STUFF\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\t\nSUBSCRIBEE\nComments (0):\nNo comments yet, but you can be the first\nADD COMMENT:\n\t\n\t\nADD COMMENT\nCATEGORY\nAuto\n2\nBlog\n7\nCourses\n1\nDriving\n1\nInstructors\n1\nMotorbicles\n1\nUncategorized\n2\nSERTIFICATE\nABOUT\n\nhave been serving NYC with its 8 branches and completed 5k+ students in last 10 years.

But now, researchers are using pioneering drones to scout out and map the miles of algae mats.\n\nThe Antarctic algae begin growing in early spring and rely on the small amount of sunlight that penetrates the ice to survive. They play a key role in the Antarctic food chain by supplying food for krill and other tiny animals.\n\nWITH A RADIOMETER THAT MEASURES HOW MUCH LIGHT EACH CLUMP OF ALGAE ABSORBS. BASED ON THE MEASUREMENTS, SCIENTISTS CAN PREDICT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALGAE GROWING UNDER THE ICE.\n\nThe diving drones are 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) long and are shaped like torpedoes. The devices are deployed from holes that the researchers cut into the thick ice using an oil burner and a steam drill. The carefully carved holes also happen to be an ideal entry point for hunting seals, and sometimes, the researchers have to share their space with seals and sea lions that crowd around the heaters set up to keep the holes from icing over.\n\nAlgae growing on the bottom of sea ice absorb light at different wavelengths. Each torpedo-shaped drone is equipped with a radiometer that measures how much light each clump of algae absorbs. Based on the measurements, scientists can predict the total amount of algae growing under the ice.\n\nGET MORE STUFF\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\t\nSUBSCRIBEE\nComments (3):\nAndry Lincoln\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore tempor incididun dolore tempor magna aliqua\n\nReply\nAndry Lincoln\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore tempor incididun dolore tempor magna aliqua\n\nReply\nAndry Lincoln\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore tempor incididun dolore tempor magna aliqua\n\nReply\nADD COMMENT:\n\t\n\t\nADD COMMENT\nCATEGORY\nAuto\n2\nBlog\n7\nCourses\n1\nDriving\n1\nInstructors\n1\nMotorbicles\n1\nUncategorized\n2\nSERTIFICATE\nABOUT\n\nhave been serving NYC with its 8 branches and completed 5k+ students in last 10 years.
